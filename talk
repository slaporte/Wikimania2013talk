% Open Licensing: Culture, Data, Software
% Luis Villa + Stephen LaPorte
% August 9, 2013 - Wikimania Hong Kong

Why are we here?
----------------

- the state of open licensing: culture, data, software

- impact on (and questions for?) Wikimedians and Wiki projects

Who We Are
----------

- Luis Villa

<!-- data, source -->

- Stephen LaPorte

<!-- culture -->

Open Data
---------

<!-- Distinguish data from culture (DB rights, protection issues -->

### New Licenses: Open Government

 - typically permissive
 - growing number
 - can have subtle differences

Data Trends
-----------

### Database licensing

<!-- key examples: CC0, ODbL -->

### Increased gov't publication

<!-- positive: lots of interesting new information! -->
<!-- possible negative: increased gov't screwups, learning curve -->

### License proliferation

<!-- Open Definition trying to play same role as OSI -->

Data Questions
--------------

### Incoming data: what licenses?

### Advocacy for "right" gov't licenses?

Open Culture
------------

### New Licenses: CC4

- *good:* readability, i18n, attribution
- *tricky:* database rights
- *expectations:* timeline

Culture Trends
--------------

### Increased concern about compatibility

<!-- good problem to have: increased remix between open licenses -->

<!-- CC doing positive work in this area -->

### Social networks

- Terms of Service may not allow compliance
- UI may not allow (easy) compliance 

### Open Educational Resources

<!-- big new source of content; lots of NC --> 

### Minimal enforcement (so far)

<!-- no visible trends -->

Culture Questions
-----------------

- CC 4: timeline, process?

- Enforcement?

- Improved CC licensing on social networks?

<!-- - Commons licensing review? -->

Open Source
-----------

### New Licenses: not so new!

- AGPL
- Mozilla Public License
- Eclipse, copyleft-next (both upcoming)

<!-- none huge, but reflect a trend towards readability, better patent language -->

Source Trends
-------------
 
### More permissive licenses

<!-- javascript; may be an issue in some places if we are producing GPL javascript -->

<!-- 
-   Large increase in permissive licenses

    -   Not clear if this is merely perceived or actually real

-   Slow, but stubborn, increase in AGPL

    -   Split motives: some genuine free software, some dual-licensing/"fearware"

-   Increased understanding that GPL is defacto permissive in the web services space

    -   No recommendation here that Mediawiki software move to AGPL or permissive, but potentially something to consider

-->

### Perception of increased enforcement

<!-- not clear there is actual enforcement, but definitely increased concern -->

### Clear that licenses are enforceable

<!-- Challenges in enforcement are not tied to licenses: more about things like copyright ownership, proving infringement, etc. -->

Source Questions
----------------

- GPL javascript?
- Permissive v. AGPL?

So now what?
